# Description

QuanTom and Jerry is an educational game that merges the classic cat-and-mouse chase with the puzzling principles of quantum mechanics. Based on the mysterious workings of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, this game tasks you with locating Jerry while anticipating his next move. But remember, in the quantum realm, having clarity in one means uncertainty in the other. 

As you relentlessly pursue Jerry amidst the game's fluctuating dynamics, always remember that you're witnessing the bizarre principles of quantum physics, now magnified to a tangible, real-world scale. Embark on this adventure, and may quantum probability favor you!
